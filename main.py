# TODO: The problem. A line l and a point P in R3 are given.
# (1) Determine whether the point P lies on the line l.
# (2) If P is not in the line l, find the plane that contains l and P.
# (3) Find equation of the plane that passes through P perpendicular to l. (4) Find the line that passes through P and perpendicular to l.
